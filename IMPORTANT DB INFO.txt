there is cascade mode in deleting on database.
If you delete a admin user, you lose all fairytales which was added by this user!
Delete USER == Delete Fairytale
Delete USER == Delete Uploaded Images

when role gets higher, then user has more privileges


standard user role == 1 -- add own images
administrator role == 4 -- add own images, create new fairytales
super root    role == 6   -- add own images, create new fairytales, edit & delete users' fairytales, grant privileges
